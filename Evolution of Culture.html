      <p>
        The definition of culture has changed immensely because culture used to be related to ethnicity but nowadays it is being identified as a way of life and this is a very vague definition and this basically means that by creating a new lifestyle, you create a new culture.
      </p>

        Culture used to be defined as a concept revolving around beliefs, values and norms. Due to the change in culture generally focusing on modernisation, the definition of culture has changed.

        <h3>The effect of time on Culture</h3>
        <p>Time has had an immense effect on how culture has either developed or regressed. A lot cultures have evolved as the demand of technology has increased and this encouraged cultures to introduce new developments to their practices which have help increase ease of life in general and how effectively they are able to do simple tasks like communicate different things and transport different culture-specific things. Although culture has had multiple positive implications on culture, time has also negatively affected some cultures has some cultures have been forgotten as time has passed and since the development of new weapons and the sharing of cultural perspective, there has been culture based conflict using weapons of mass murder.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, as culture has evolved, many people have gotten very engulfed in the use of technology and have lost their culture has a part of their identity as most of the youth have been more interested in adapting to the Western lifestyle as it seems more "luxurious", sadly this has caused many people to forget their background and has reduced cultural diversity</p>
