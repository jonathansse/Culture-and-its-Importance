      <p>
        The problem that culture is facing currently has been elaborately explained and the consequences have been clearly outlined, lack of diversity and more. These problems also have ripple effects on every other aspect of humanity and people's identity.

      <p>
        "Culture used to be defined as a concept revolving around beliefs, values and norms. Due to the change in culture generally focusing on modernisation, the definition of culture has changed". There is a solution for this problem though it isn't very straightforward and requires effort from especially the youth population because they are the population who have the largest effect on decisions made that will affect their futures. This situation is currently in the hands of the youth, it can start at home by taking up more interest in your cultural heritage and developing an open mind, by starting at home then raising awareness around your community in your home, school or even neighbourhood, you can make a big difference and allow people to take up more interest in their roots and understand themselves better.

        Another method you could use to help solve this problem is that instead of just raising awareness, you can take the initiative to go and learn about your culture and then educate other people on the mulitple practices and make sure that they gain interest and then encourage them to also go and learn about their cultural heritage. A problem that this will solve is mainly the social problem that people don't know who they are in terms of identity and why they have different things compared to others. One's culture can explain all of this and help one fully identify themselves. Culture can explain why someone is tall, short, thin, fat or anything else either physical or mental, culture hence plays a big role in people's identities. So in simpler terms, you can educate the people around you instead of just raise awareness, you can teach pepole about the importance of preserving their cultures and how this can affect one's daily life.
