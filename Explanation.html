        As stated in the page of the evolution, in the present day, most people are forgetting their culture as a part of their identity and adapting more towards the Western lifestyle. This has had an extremely negative impact upon cultural diversity and has also caused quite a lot of cultures to either be forgotten or become very vulnerable to change refering to the fact that many people don't even know their mother tongue yet still label themselves as members of a specific culture. Cultures like the Maasain, the Navajo, the Maentz and many more have become much more vulnerable to change due to modernisation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Culture used to be defined as a concept revolving around beliefs, values and norms. Due to the change in culture generally focusing on modernisation, the definition of culture has changed."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the real world, diversity plays a big role in everyday things like business, technology, media and many more. By people ignoring and avoiding their cultural heritage, this has a negative ripple effect on these other areas as there will be less sharing of new ideas due to everyone thinking similarly, less innovation, less trade and overall will reduce humanity's potential to develop and grow. According to statistics recorded in 2015, most companies were able to make over 29% profit with a diverse staff compared to if everyone was from the same place and this was due to the fact that more people were able to work more effectively as they were much more comfortable in their current position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Providing a real life example of Silicon Valley, as per now most people around the tech valley are white and male and are aimed at solving problems for only the rich, young and single according to 'The Atlantic' and therefore Silicon Valley hasn't been able to introduce any new innovations that have changed the world. If there was diversity within Silicon Valley, humanity's potential would grow and there would be much more new innovation that would be world changing. Try to imagine a world with no diversity. This means no new ideas, no sharing of information, no new experience, can you imagine how backward the human race would be in terms of development, technology and other things, this just goes to show how big of a role culture plays on human development and basic functionality.
